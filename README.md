# Esphome-House-Alarm
Inexpensive alarm system based on Esphome with Home Assistant integration.

# Background
I live in a property with 4 well spaced out buildings that I would like to protectand and monitor, a house, two barns and a static caravan.

My goal is to build an alarm system for each building around the following objectives:

- An ESP32 and Esphome at the heart
- Off the shelf parts
- Inexpensive to build
- Easy to extend
- Easy to program
- Works independanly (Home Assistant not required)
- Has full integration with Home Assistant over WiFi or Ethernet
- Fully wired
- Battery backup

## Why not use WiFi / Zigbee / Z-Wave sensors?

I have experentmented with all 3 of these wireless systems but I've stuggled with reliabilty, namely:

- Connections dropping / Interferance
- Battery issues
- Home Assisant / Z2M / Wifi issues
- Power loss
- Updates
- Reboots
